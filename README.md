# Final_Project-Group_8
R package implementing logistic regression using numerical optimization. The package must contain the basic functions to perform logistic regression (e.g. estimate the coefficient vector Î² which includes the independent variables/predictors plus the intercept) and obtain different outputs from the procedure.
The outputs include:
initial values for optimization
bootstrap confidence intervals
Logistic curve
Confusion matrix
prevalence
accuracy
sensitivity
specificity
false discovery rate
diagnostic odds ratio
