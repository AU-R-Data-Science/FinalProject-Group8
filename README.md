# Final_Project-Group_8
R package implementing logistic regression using numerical optimization. The package must contain the basic functions to perform logistic regression (e.g. estimate the coefficient vector Î² which includes the independent variables/predictors plus the intercept) and obtain different outputs from the procedure.
The outputs include:
initial values for optimization
bootstrap confidence intervals
Logistic curve
Confusion matrix
prevalence
accuracy
sensitivity
specificity
false discovery rate
diagnostic odds ratio

Descriptions of the relevant functions that can be used from this package


initialbeta():This function can help calculating the initial beta value with X,y which are a matrix of beta and numerical vector


optimizing():This function will based on the original logistic equation to calculte the summary of beta with X,y and beta  X a matrix of beta and y a numerical vector

estBeta(X,y): This function is used to calculte the beta estimation with list of beta hat and betan

interval(X,y,alpha,B=20): This function will help to calculate the confidence interval with bootsrap with default number of 20.

confusion_matrix(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5): This function will help to calculate the Confusion matrix

Prevalence(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
Accuracy(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
Sensitivity(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
Specificity(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
False_Discovery_Rate(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
Diagnostic_Odds_ration(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5)
The six functions shows above can be used for calcultaing the six different metrics.

prevalencegrid(X,y,bhat,cut=0.5): This one is used for ploting Prevalence over a grid of cut-off value.

logiplot(X,y): This function can help to draw the logistic curve
